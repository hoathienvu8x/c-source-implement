 *
 * @brief Interface for creating vector.
 *
 * This file declares functions, types and macros for creating containers
 * for data of any type (similar to vectors used in C++).
 * 
 * Creating and destroying Vectors:
 *      vector_new
 *      vector_delete
 *
 * Finding important indices:
 *      vector_begin
 *      vector_end
 *
 * Info about capacity:
 *      vector_size
 *      vector_resize
 *      vector_capacity
 *      vector_empty
 *
 * Accessing elements:
 *      vector_front
 *      vector_back
 *      vector_at
 *
 * Modifying Vector content:
 *      vector_push_back
 *      vector_pop_back
 *      vector_insert
 *      vector_erase
 *      vector_swap
 *      vector_clear
